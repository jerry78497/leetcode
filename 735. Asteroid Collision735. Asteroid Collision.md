Tag: `Stack`
## Note
1. 這題一開始用del 的方式去刪除原有的元素, 提交之後發現有點慢
2. 點開最快的解答, 換成用append & pop 去操作stuck, 好像也沒有快多少. 搞不懂

## Code
    class Solution:
        def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
            
            stack = []
            for asteroid in asteroids:
                while stack and asteroid < 0 and stack[-1] > 0:
                    if abs(asteroid) > stack[-1]:
                        stack.pop()
                        continue
                    elif abs(asteroid) == stack[-1]:
                        stack.pop()
                    break
                else:
                    stack.append(asteroid)
            
            return stack

## Complexity analysis
### Time complexity: O(n)
1. It only iterates one time through the list, since one asteroid can only be process twice(append and pop in the stack), the total time would equel to O(n).

### Space complexity: O(n)
1. The max size of stack is same as `len(asteroids)`, it's the only one take space.

## Idea
> I can solve this problem by lots of if ans else condition, but I want a clear one.

> I write an ans by list and del, but it take too much on time and space.

> I used list.append and list.pop(fastest ans in this problem) still not fast
