## Note
### Medium
1. 條件運算是先運算所有and, 成立後再運算所有or, 所以line 18才能這樣寫
2. 學會heapify的用法, python真的好方便
3. 解題方法很好想, coding比較難
   
## Code
    class Solution:
        def totalCost(self, costs: List[int], k: int, candidates: int) -> int:
            
            head_candidates = costs[:candidates]
            tail_candidates = costs[max(candidates, len(costs) - candidates):]
            next_head, next_tail = candidates, len(costs) - candidates - 1
    
            heapify(head_candidates)
            heapify(tail_candidates)
    
            ans = 0
    
            for _ in range(k):
                if not tail_candidates or head_candidates and head_candidates[0] <= tail_candidates[0]:
                    ans += heappop(head_candidates)
                    if next_tail >= next_head:
                        heappush(head_candidates, costs[next_head])
                        next_head += 1
                else:
                    ans += heappop(tail_candidates)
                    if next_tail >= next_head:
                        heappush(tail_candidates, costs[next_tail])
                        next_tail -= 1
    
            return ans

## Complexity analysis
### Time complexity: O((k+m)*log m)
1. Initialize two priority queues of size _m_, which takes O(m*log⁡ m) time.
2. Loop for _k_ times and push new element into priority queue takes O(log m) times, so this process takes O(k*log m).
3. In Python, heapq.heapify() creates the priority queue in O(n) times. Therefore the time complexity is O((k+m)*log m).
### Space complexity: O(m)
1. We need store head_candidates and tail_candidates.

## Idea
> The discription didn't say, but example shows that candidates were choosed from start and end of array
